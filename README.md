How to use this application: 
    in the application.properties file change the following:
        1 - server.port (optional)
        2 - paypal.client.id to your client Id
        3 - paypal.client.secret to your client secret
        4 - paypal.mode to live if you're pushing your application for production (sandbox mode is for development use only)
Warning: Do not try to use the client-id and the client-secret listed in the application.properties file cause it has already been deleted
And you're done :)
